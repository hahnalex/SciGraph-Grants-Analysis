### Grant-to-CSV Output

This directory holds the CSV files that are generated by the grants\_to\_csv.py script. This CSV files can be used with
the Neo4j batch-import tool to load large data sets into Neo4j graph databases.

Subject and object nodes are stored in a few different files, based on what type of data they represent. Here is a list
of node files that will be generated in this directory:
- funding.csv (includes fundingAmount and fundingCurrency nodes)
- id.csv (includes grantID, contributionID, scigraphID, and articleID nodes)
- metadata.csv (includes various metadata nodes, e.g. title, abstract, license, publication, etc.)
- org.csv (includes fundingOrganization and recipientOrganization nodes)
- type.csv (includes nodes that represent type, e.g. Grant, Contribution, etc.)
- year.csv (includes startYear and endYear nodes)

Finally, the relationships between nodes are specified in the relationship.csv file. This includes a "START_ID", an
"END_ID", and a "TYPE" that specifies a given subject-predicate-object relationship. The START\_ID and END\_ID are used
to identify the nodes that are added in the above mentioned node files. The TYPE specifies the type of relationship for
a given triple.
